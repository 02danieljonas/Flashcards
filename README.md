## **Project Overview**

The 3 main goals of our project are to:
1.  Create a ***free*** study tool, with a simple & straightforward UI;
2.  Provide a way for users to self-test their knowledge;
3.  & aid in the use of the **retrieval practice** method so that users memorize, retain & retrieve information more efficiently.

Users will be able to sign up, create a profile, & create sets of digital flashcards based on any subject they choose. The flashcards can be then reviewed based on the mode the user chooses. The website will be searchable for other sets of flashcards or other user profiles.
