## **Reflection Questions**

##### How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 

  * The pacing was just right, but an extra week or two would've been super helpful (i.e. SITE being 11-12 weeks instead of 10).

##### To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

  * Our plan didn't change much; we hardly implemented any stretch features, but the website is functioning at its basic level and the sky is the limit for the amount of improvements to be made.

##### How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?

  * The labs and weekly assignments were extremely helpful. It served as a reference for much of the project code.

##### Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

  * Yes, we were definitely prepared for sprint planning. We learned our lesson with adding too many tasks into one sprint though.

##### When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

  * The instructors & TAs were the most helpful in getting us unstuck with our code. The wireframing was essential for planning our UI.
