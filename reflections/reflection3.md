Team Members:  **Osaru Elaiho**  •  **Daniel Jonas**  •  **Hayley Simmons**



## **Reflection Questions**

##### Name at least one successful thing this week.

  * We're down to squashing bugs and improving our UI.

##### What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

  * We accidentally deleted a lot of progress during a merge conflict.

##### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

  * We didn't finish all the tasks in Sprint 3, but we did finish the most important one which was user profile editing.

##### Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

  * ChakraUI has been a godsend in building the interface.

##### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

  * Most (if not all) of our stretch features are at risk. All of our key features are pretty much finished, with the exception of a few bugs.
