## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Our backend is essentially complete and we're close to wrapping up core features.


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

This week our group lost a good chunk of time trying to figure out an issue we were having when connecting the front and back end. Roy(TA) was able to help us solve the issue. Also, we were down a pod mate this week so our workload was a tad bit bigger. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes, we initially placed a bulk of our core featues in Sprint 1 and instead chose to add and complete them this week in Sprint 2. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Roy(TA) gave our group a great tool to create and improve upon our UI. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
 
At the moment, no features or user stories are "at risk". Our group is still on pace to sticking with our original plan.
