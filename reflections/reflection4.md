## **Reflection Questions**

##### Name at least one successful thing this week.

  * The website UI looks a lot cleaner.

##### What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

  * Upgrading the UI has been tedious.

##### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

  * No, we did not finish all the planned tasks; Some of them did not fit well into the direction our project went.

##### Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

  * Yes. The provided resources, especially the TAs, helped execute our capstone project.

##### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

  * The recommendation system, matching system, and advanced review mode (stretch features) are "at risk" right now. We will continue to work on them if we get the chance.
