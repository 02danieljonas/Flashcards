## **Reflection Questions**

##### Name at least one successful thing this week.

  * All the core flashcard components are almost finished.

##### What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

  * Our group faced problems with getting the flashcard components set up, setting up SASS, and accidentally deleting A LOT of progress by doing a git merge after a git revert.

##### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

  * No, we did not complete all of our planned tasks. Most of our core features somehow ended up going into Sprint 1, which gave us a lot of work to do, and a podmate sadly couldn't get much work done.

##### Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

  * We still need help setting up the milestones in GitHub.

##### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

  * Nothing is "at risk" right now; Week 4 is planned to be the week we complete unfinished features or integrate something nice from AWS.
