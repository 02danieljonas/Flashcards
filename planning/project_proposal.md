# Project Proposal

## Problem Statement

Students who want to study, but don't know how or where to start, need a simple way to do so while effectively learning the material.


## Description

The purpose is to provide a simple learning tool for students to use while studying. The key feature is the student being able to create digital flashcards in order to memorize & learn their material in an easy way. They can be saved for later, & accessed anytime.


## Expected Features List

##### **Key features:**
  - User can create an account/make a profile.
  - User can create folders for organizing their flashcards by class, subject, semester, etc.
  - User can create their flashcards; listing the term/subject on one side & definition/explanation on the other.
      - *User can create as many flashcards as they choose.*
      - *User has to create a title for their set, but adding a description will be optional.* 
      - *User can save their progress in case they don't finish a set all at once.*
  - User can view their set of flashcards after saving them.
  
##### **Stretch features:**
  - User can search for a subject, class, school, other users, etc., & view other flashcards matching the results.
  - User can make their folders/flashcards public, allowing others to view them, or private, not allowing others to view them.
  - User can choose a mode of studying their flashcards, such as:
    - Viewing them in the default mode (individual card by card; flip to view the other side);
     - *Cards can be viewed:* 
        - *term --> definition (term --> flip --> definition)* 
        - *definition --> term*
    - Or matching the correct term & definition.
     - *Matching mode can be timed or untimed (time limits from 10-60 seconds, with 5 second increases).*
     - *Cards can be matched:*
        - *term --> definition* 
        - *definition --> term*
  - User can highlight items in their cards.
  - User can customize their flashcards by:
    - *Choosing a different card color;*
    - *Choosing a different font and/or font color;*
    - *Choosing the orientation of the cards (portrait/landscape);*
    - *Or choosing a different highlight color.*
  - User can choose to hide/unhide their finished flashcards, while still creating the set, for the convenience of less scrolling when you         have a lot of cards.


## Related Work

Quizlet is the main inspiration for this project. We want ours to stand out by: 
  - Offering every single feature for free (Quizlet wants users to pay for the card-customizing & highlighting features); 
  - & having a simpler UI for things like:
    - Creating multiple flashcards at once (Quizlet makes users create one at a time);
    - Hiding the finished flashcards while still in the process of creating the set (Quizlet doesn't have this feature, so the more cards you       have the more you have to scroll);
    - & simplifying the user profile interface to only include profile info in one tab, & the user's folders/flashcards in                           another (if the user made their stuff public; otherwise that section will be empty). 


## Open Questions

We will need to research many things, such as: how to save the user's progress if they need to finish their flashcards later, & how to create folders for organizing. For the stretch features, we will need to research how to implement timers, the customizing options, & basically everything else there.
