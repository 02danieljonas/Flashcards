# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Osaru Elaiho, Daniel Jonas, & Hayley Simmons**


## Problem Statement

Students who want to study, but don't know how or where to start, need a simple way to do so while effectively learning the material.


## Description

The purpose is to provide a simple learning tool for students to use while studying. The key feature is the student being able to create digital flashcards in order to memorize & learn their material in an easy way. They can be saved for later, & accessed anytime.


## Expected Features List

##### **Key features:**
  - User can create an account/make a profile.
  - User can create folders for organizing their flashcards by class, subject, semester, etc.
  - User can create their flashcards; listing the term/subject on one side & definition/explanation on the other.
      - *User can create as many flashcards as they choose.*
      - *User has to create a title for their set, but adding a description will be optional.* 
      - *User can save their progress in case they don't finish a set all at once.*
  - User can view their set of flashcards after saving them.
      - *The default view: viewing each card individually (like a slideshow)*
          - *Cards can be viewed:* 
              - *term --> definition (term --> **flip** --> definition)* 
              - *definition --> term*  
  
##### **Stretch features:**
  - Website is responsive.
  - User can search for a subject, class, school, other users, etc.
  - User can view other people's flashcards.
      - *User can make their folders/flashcards public or private.
          - *Public allows others to search & view them* 
          - *Private doesn't allow others to view them.*
          - *User can create a shareable link for their folder/flashcards while set to private.*
  - User can choose a mode of studying their flashcards, such as:
      - *The default mode (as described above);*
    - Or matching the correct term & definition.
       - *Matching mode can be timed or untimed.*
          - *time limit range: 10-60 sec. w/ 5 sec. increases*
          - *optional field to input their own time*
       - *Cards can be matched:*
          - *term --> definition* 
          - *definition --> term*
  - User can highlight items in their cards.
  - User can customize their flashcards by:
      - *Choosing a different card color;*
      - *Choosing a different font and/or font color;*
      - *Choosing the orientation of the cards (portrait/landscape);*
      - *Or choosing a different highlight color.*
  - User can choose to hide/unhide their finished flashcards, while still creating the set, for the convenience of less scrolling when you         have a lot of cards.


## Related Work

[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/latest) is the main inspiration for this project. We want ours to stand out by: 
  - Offering every single feature for free (Quizlet wants users to pay for the card-customizing & highlighting features); 
  - & having a simpler UI for things like:
      - Creating multiple flashcards at once (Quizlet makes users create one at a time);
      - Hiding the finished flashcards while still in the process of creating the set (Quizlet doesn't have this feature, so the more cards           you have the more you have to scroll);
      - & simplifying the user profile interface to only include profile info in one tab, & the user's folders/flashcards in                           another (if the user made their stuff public; otherwise that section will be empty). 


## Open Questions

We will need to research many things, such as: how to save the user's progress if they need to finish their flashcards later, & how to create folders for organizing. For the stretch features, we will need to research how to implement timers, the customizing options, & basically everything else there.
