# **Project Proposal**

Team Members:   **Osaru Elaiho**  •  **Daniel Jonas**  •  **Hayley Simmons**



## **Problem Statement**

Despite being taught that studying leads to academic success, students are instead spoon-fed information that reflects on our tests & quizzes. Consequently, many students adopt the habit of learning the material without dedicating any outside hours, with the goal of just getting by.

In short, ***students don't know how to learn/study.***

According to an article from *[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/04/15/many-students-dont-know-how-study-heres-how-parents-can-help/)*:

*"Researchers and experienced educators have found that often **students don’t have good study habits and skills**, or that **they rely on strategies that don’t work...**"*

*[Education World](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/04/15/many-students-dont-know-how-study-heres-how-parents-can-help/)* adds on to this statement:

*"…some approaches that teachers and parents recommend for studying such as **re-reading**, **highlighting** or **summarizing material**, might **not actually be effective**, especially over time."*



## **Description**

The 3 main goals of our project are to:
1.  Create a ***free*** study tool, with a simple & straightforward UI;
2.  Provide a way for users to self-test their knowledge;
3.  & aid in the use of the **retrieval practice** method so that users memorize, retain & retrieve information more efficiently.

**Retrieval practice** means ***to actively recall information from memory***.

It's one of the most efficient study methods, according to sources such as *[Education Corner](https://www.educationcorner.com/retrieval-practice/)*, but it can also be one of the most challenging; it requires a deep level of focus/concentration. However, it's efficient because it encourages long-term learning, & there are many ways to practice retrieving information: *practice tests*, *quizzes*, *flashcards*, etc.

Users will be able to sign up, create a profile, & create sets of digital flashcards based on any subject they choose. The flashcards can be then reviewed based on the mode the user chooses. The website will be searchable for other sets of flashcards or other user profiles.



## **Expected Features List**

##### Terms Used:
- **Inverse View (Included in all modes by default)**
    - *term --> **flip** --> definition*
    - *definition --> **flip** --> term*
- **Optional Modes:**
    - **Review Mode - Default Key Feature**
        - viewing each card individually like a slideshow
        - can set a time limit between flipping over cards, in order to allow the user to figure out the answer
            - time limit range: 5-30 sec. w/ 5 sec. increases 
    - **Matching Mode - Stretch feature**
        - match the correct term w/ its definition, & vice versa
        - can be **timed** or untimed
            - *time limit range: 10-60 sec. w/ 5 sec. increases*
            - *optional field to input their own time (max 60 sec.)*
    - **Quiz Mode - Stretch feature**
        - same as matching mode, but w/ a scoring system
- **Sets**
    - a set of flashcards
- **Cards**
    - an individual flashcard
- **Public**
    - when a set/folder is searchable on the website & can be viewed on user's profiles
- **Private**
    - when a set/folder is NOT searchable or viewable by others
    - only viewable by creating a shareable link (anyone can see)
##### Key features:
- User can create an account/make a profile.
- **Registered** users can:
    - Create sets
        - *Unlimited cards per set*
        - *Sets must have a title; a description will be optional* 
        - *Can save their progress for later, in case a set isn't finished*
        - *Can create folders for organization*
        - *Can view their sets (in the default mode) after saving them*
- **Unregistered** users will only be able to view the landing page.
##### Stretch features:
- Website is responsive.
- **Unregistered** users can:
    - Search the site for **public** sets & other users
    - View other's **public or private** folders/sets 
- **Registered** users can:
    - Do the above tasks
    - Create sets
        - *Can hide the cards while in the creation process (adds the convenience of less scrolling when there's many cards)*
        - *Can import notes from other platforms (ex. Google Docs) into a set*
    - Highlight items in their finished sets
    - Customize their sets:
        - *Card colors*
        - *Fonts/font colors*
        - *Alter the card orientation (portrait/landscape)*
        - *Highlighter colors*
    - Have optional modes of studying their flashcards:
        - *Review*
        - *Matching*
        - *Quiz*


## **Related Work**

**[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/latest)** is our main inspiration (& competition) for this project. We want Flashi to stand out by: 
  - Offering every single feature for free (Quizlet wants users to pay for the card-customizing & highlighting features);
  - Making the user set a time limit between flipping the cards (Quizlet doesn't have this feature);
  - & having a simpler UI for things like:
      - Creating multiple flashcards at once (Quizlet makes users create one at a time);
      - Hiding the finished flashcards while still in the process of creating the set (Quizlet doesn't have this feature, so the more cards           you have the more you have to scroll);
      - & simplifying the user profile interface to only include profile info in one tab, & the user's folders/flashcards in                           another (if the user made their stuff public; otherwise that section will be empty). 


## **Open Questions**

We will need to research many things, such as how to save the user's progress if they need to finish their flashcards later, & how to create folders for organizing. For the stretch features, we will need to research how to implement timers, the customizing options, & basically everything else there.
