Despite his shortcomings in preparation, Bob's is now determined to succeed and dead-set on adequately preparing himself for the future.
 * Sarah is a rising junior at the University of Texas studying biology with hopes to take her MCAT this upcoming fall.

However, recently Sarah was diagonosed with mild ADHD and prescribed medicine to help her focus. As she approaches her MCAT, Sarah hopes to take advantage of her newfound clarity in order to study well.

Mrs.Smith is quite familiar with technology and is aware of positive effect it can have on young minds as they begin to develop.

However, after attending a teaching conference, Mrs. Brown has had a change of heart and hopes to employ the use of user, beginner friendly technology that will ensure a smooth transition into online learning.
